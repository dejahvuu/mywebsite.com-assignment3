            <h2 class="box3">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                At Plate to Palette (PTP), our mission is to ensure that no young adult has to choose between food and their future. 
                We are dedicated to nourishing both body and creativity by providing free meals, a safe space, and artistic opportunities
                for young adults (18-24) in the Greater Toronto Area. Through food security and creative expression, we aim to uplift and
                empower individuals, fostering a supportive community where everyone has the chance to thrive.
                <br>
                <br>
                Founded in 2004, PTP began as a grassroots initiative to provide meals to young artists struggling to balance their passion
                with financial hardship. What started as a small meal-sharing program quickly grew into a space where young people could
                connect, create, and find support beyond just food. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Over the years, we have collaborated with organizations such as the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), local food banks,
                and community art programs to expand our reach and provide even greater opportunities for young adults.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, PTP serves hundreds of young adults each year, offering nutritious meals, free art workshops, and mentorship
                programs designed to inspire and uplift. We provide a welcoming environment where young people can explore their
                passions—whether they are artists, musicians, writers, or simply individuals seeking a safe and supportive space.
                Our Nourish & Create program has helped countless participants regain confidence, build friendships, and discover
                new opportunities through food and artistic expression.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking ahead, we aim to expand our reach, ensuring that no young adult in the GTA goes hungry or feels isolated.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our goals include: <br>
                - Increasing the number of meals served per year <br>
                - Expanding our volunteer network to provide more mentorship and creative guidance <br>
                - Establishing more accessible locations for PTP programming <br>
                - Developing career and skill-building workshops alongside our creative programs
                <br>
                <br>
                Through our work, we strive to create lasting change—not just by feeding individuals for a day, but by providing
                them with the tools, resources, and community to build a sustainable future. At PTP, we believe that when young
                people are nourished, their creativity and potential know no bounds.
